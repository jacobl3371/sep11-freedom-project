# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* Imagine you're a prospective immigrant looking to move to a new country. You need to access crucial resources to allow for your emmigration, but there are no resources available in your language! Fear no more, for [our immigration resource](https://immigration-resource.vercel.app/) offers a fully in-depth resoruce that can be translated into your langauge.

## Product
* Our product is full of immigration resoucres, stories, legal help, and translation services to immigrants all over the globe.

## Process
* We built this app with a drea,. We wanted to create a more acessible furture for immigrants.

  1. We started learning out tool. Jacob learned Express.js and I learned react.js
  2. We started to timker and build prototypes that will help us
  3. We slowy built the app in VS code building componenets
  4. Then we worked on the initl18.js `code snippits`
  5. Finally we built it making the translation work

## Conclusion
* Takeaways: Problem decomposition- We had to work through many probelms and break them down step by step. Each probelm lead to another problem that needed to be solved to eliminate bugs. COmunication- We had to communicate a lot and building two seprate files then combining them was difficult. I had to `fetch()` Jacob's code and build the frontend up.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"

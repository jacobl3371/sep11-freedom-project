# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* Imagine you're a prospective immigrant looking to move to a new country. You need to access crucial resources to allow for your emmigration, but there are no resources available in your language! Fear no more, for [our immigration resource](https://immigration-resource.vercel.app/) offers a fully in-depth web application to help you immigrate that can be translated into your langauge, and it automatically is! (*demo website with a VPN or Tor)*.

## Product
* Our product is full of helpful resources, stories, legal help, and translation services to immigrants all over the globe.

## Process
* We built this app with a dream. We wanted to create a more acessible furture for immigrants.

  1. We started learning out tool. Jacob learned Express.js and I learned react.js
  2. We started to tinker and build prototypes that will help us, such as the [mvp](https://github.com/jacobl3371/sep11-freedom-project/blob/main/tool/ip-immigration-app/backend/index.js) that Jacob made solely with Node and Express.
  3. We slowy put together the application with React in VS code; building components
  5. Finally we built it and made the translation work

## Conclusion
* Takeaways: Problem decomposition- We had to work through many probelms and break them down step by step. Each probelm lead to another problem that needed to be solved to eliminate bugs.
* Comunication- We had to communicate a lot and building two seprate files then combining them was difficult. I had to `fetch()` Jacob's code and build the frontend up.

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"

## Timeline

#### MVP (All Me)

- [X] Make the backend express API from scratch that gets the user's IP address and will be used to automatically translate the webpage based on their region:
  - [X] Get the user's IP address (2/16)
  - [X] Finish the API; apply the user's IP address in order to automatically translate the webpage (will probably be an object with IP addresses assigned to regions which correspond to the language) (3/9)
- [X] Refactor the Express backend API to retroactively update the html text sent in a separate React frontend which can be tested by hosting the fullstack app from that frontend directory, accessing the website in Tor Browser and reloading the Tor Circuit which should update the IP Address and subsequent region that just the API returns which is then to be used by the frontend to automatically translate the text. (3/25)

####  MVP (Caleb)

- [X] Finish learning enough React JS so that we can rebuild the frontend with react which will make the webpage load super fast! (3/15)
- [X] Design the frontend of the webpage (4/1)
- [X] Test translation feature for the html select drop-down component (4/15)
  - [X] Look for bugs
- [ ] Write the articles for the app (4/15)

### Beyond MVP

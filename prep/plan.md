# Plan

## Tool: Node/Express JS
## Product: Self-Translating Immigration App

---

## Timeline

#### MVP (-All Me)

- [ ] Finish making the backend express API from scratch to get the user's IP address and automatically translate the webpage based on their region:
  - [ ] Get the user's IP address (2/16)
    - [ ] test this by creating a function that automatically affects an element on the webpage according to what the IP address is (2/20)
  - [ ] Finish the API; apply the user's IP address in order to automatically translate the webpage (will probably be a 3d object with IP addresses assigned to regions and regions assigned to language routes):
    - [ ] I will have to figure out how to create/incorporate a function into my API which automatically directs the user to different language routes (app.get index.html/en, app.get index.html/es, etc.) (4/1)

####  MVP (Caleb)

- [ ] Design the frontend of the webpage to make it how he wants it to look so I can build the app with vanilla css and incorporate my API (3/15)
- [ ] Finish learning enough React JS so that we can rebuild the frontend with react which will make the webpage load super fast! (4/10)
- [ ] Test translation feature (4/1)
  - [ ] Look for bugs
- [ ] Write the articles for the app (4/1)

### Beyond MVP

- [ ] Create a authentication page (Caleb) (4/3)
- [ ] Design a fake database (Caleb) (4/3)
- [ ] Translate into more niche languages like arabic and norwigian (Jacob) (4/3)
